//	dataAccess.js holds all the functions that access campaign-chart data.
// It does NOT contain:
//  - any business logic
//  - any data processing [NTS: may have to define 'data-processing' carefully at some future point]
//  - any actual data
//
// The data itself is - as at 23rd November 2019 - in data/data.js; this will change at some point and 
// it'll go into a true database.
