CURRENT TODO

Find out why the chart details aren't saving on cmd+s, wo the text field blur thing.


DESIGN NOTES

When I launch the app, I can either start a new one, or launch an existing one; this is in place.
Two more added features:
- Enabling a Munro to link to another list

TODAY IS: Monday

Immediate ToDo:
- Load today's chart automatically

The next challenges include:
- Set up an onLoad() event, or rather, add the function in at the end of app.js active code
- Determine today's date, with DDD and DD
- Go through the list of charts and as soon as you find one with both DDD and DD, flag it
- Use the drawChart() function
