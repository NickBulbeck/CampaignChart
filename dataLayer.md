This stage introduces some form of rudimentary data persistence. To begin with,
it's only runtime persistence in a file; next time around, or soon thereafter, it'll
move to being a true database.

DESIGN NOTES

When I launch the app, I can either start a new one, or launch an existing one. So: I need a pull-down menu.
To start with, the chart app contains a blank input, with a Save button.
If you click on the chart...
If you click on the New button... 
Need these combinations decided.

TODAY IS: Thursday

The next challenges include:
- Add delete munro button functionality
- Fix bug whereby a munro marked as done carries over into the next chart
- Add feature whereby a chart with done munros has them drawn as done when it loads
