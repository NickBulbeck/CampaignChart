/* Remember:
  .block
  .block__element
  .block--modifier

  ... and bear in mind that the modifier is NOT a global variable - it only applies within this block. The only global
      CSS you should write is the colour-scheme, the media query width changes and the normalise.css file (and even that
      is the exception that proves the rule). For instance: a 'large' version of something will mean one thing in a 
      button, and a different thing in a list. Remember that the whole problem with CSS is its global scope.

  NTS: to be properly BEM, I'll need to change #playArea to .playArea, and re-factor the HTML (and any JS behind the scenes that
  creates elements) to add the .playArea class to the playArea div element.
